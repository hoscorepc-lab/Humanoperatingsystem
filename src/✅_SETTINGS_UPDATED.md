│  ←    HOS Settings                ×   │
│       Customize your experience        │
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  [🎨] [🛡️] [⚡] [👁️] [🔔] [👤] [ℹ️]  │
│                                        │
│  ...settings content...                │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Navigation:**
- **← Back Arrow** (left) - Closes settings
- **× Close Button** (right) - Also closes settings
- Both work the same way - choose whichever feels natural!
