Abstract web: https://hoslabs.com/

The Human Operating System (HOS) represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence and cognitive computing, introducing a self-evolving, modular AI agent platform that mirrors human cognitive architecture while transcending traditional AI limitations. This whitepaper presents a comprehensive technical overview of HOS v3.0, detailing its theoretical foundations, architectural design, self-evolution mechanisms, and practical applications.

HOS operates on three foundational pillars: Empathetic Efficiency, Adaptive Intelligence, and Minimalist Wit. Through a sophisticated event-driven architecture comprising 26 specialized modules across Core, Human, and Research domains, HOS achieves unprecedented levels of autonomous learning, contextual awareness, and cognitive flexibility.

Key innovations include a real-time self-evolution engine capable of proposing, validating, and implementing system improvements; a neural network research framework supporting cutting-edge ML architectures; multi-agent orchestration systems with voice and visual interfaces; and blockchain-integrated financial modules. This paper examines the theoretical underpinnings of artificial consciousness, cognitive modeling, and emergent intelligence while providing detailed technical specifications for each subsystem.
